            <h4>1. Introduction</h4> <hr/>            
<p>1.1 The App enables The Retailers (“The Retailer”) to sell items and/or services from the App to customers using
the Suppl-i online shopping platform (each a "Customer").</p> 
<p>1.2 These terms and conditions ("Terms and Conditions") govern the ordering, sale, delivery, and collection of
items as ordered, and the use of the App. These Terms and Conditions are binding and enforceable against every
person that accesses or uses the App, including without limitation each. By using the App, you acknowledge that
you have read and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. You must not use the App or Telephone
Service if you do not agree to the Terms and Conditions.
</p> 
<h4>2. Important Notice</h4> <hr/>  
<p>2.1 These Terms and Conditions apply to users who are The Retailers for purposes of the Consumer Protection
Act 2008 (the "CPA").</p> 
<p>2.2 If there is any provision in these Terms and Conditions that you do not understand, it is your responsibility
to ask Suppl-i to explain it to you before you accept the Terms and Conditions by continuing to use the App.</p> 
<p>2.3 Nothing in these Terms and Conditions is intended or must be understood to unlawfully restrict, limit or
avoid any right or obligation, as the case may be, created for either you or Suppl-i in terms of the CPA</p> 
<h4>3. How it works</h4> <hr/> 
<p>3.1 You may sell items via the App. When selling items, you are required to indicate your stock availability,
product pricing, product information and product imagery.
</p> 
<p>3.2 Where you have received ordered through the App, your courier and logistics requirements will be managed
by Suppl-i and/or our courier partners.</p> 
<p>3.3 You are required to maintain the accuracy of your own products and online store on our App.</p> 
<p>3.4 You acknowledge that, notwithstanding that the item(s) ordered via the App, you confirm such order with
the relevant Customer. The sale of items is solely between the registered user and the relevant Customer.
Neither Suppl-i nor any party attending to the Courier Delivery (if applicable) is a party to that sale of any item.
Suppl-i only provides the platform to facilitate transactions between Retail stores and Customers in relation to
any item as sold by the retail store. Suppl-i is neither the buyer nor the seller of the item. </p> 
<p>3.5 Because we want you to have a safe and consistent experience, Suppl-i will be your first point of contact for
any queries arising out of or in connection with the sale of any item between a Customer and a Retail store.
Should such complaint escalate into being a dispute, although Suppl-i is entitled to become involved in an
attempt to resolve it, Suppl-i is not obliged to do so and any disputes must be resolved between the Customer
and the relevant Retail store.</p> 

<h4>4. Registration and use of the App

telephone number, personal details and any other relevant information required. You will thereafter be
requested to select your own password or be issued a randomly generated password (which you may
subsequently change).</p> 
<p>4.3 You will need to use your unique username and password to manage your e-store via the App. You agree
that a Suppl-i operator may call you to confirm your personal details, order information and amount owed. For
security purposes you agree to enter your correct username and password whenever utilizing the management
portal via the App, failing which we will not process your updates</p> 
<p>4.4 You agree and warrant that your username and password (if applicable) shall not be disclosed by you to any
third party.</p> 
<p>4.5 You agree that, once your correct username and password have been entered (in relation to the App),
irrespective of whether the use of the username and/or password is unauthorized or fraudulent, you will be
liable for changes and updates processed.</p>

access to or use of your username and/or password and to take steps to minimise any resultant loss or harm.</p>
