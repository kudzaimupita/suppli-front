                              It’s easy to set up an e-store with Suppl-i. First, register and signup to
create a Suppl-i account. Once your account has been approved and
verified, you set your shop name, location, bank details and other
relevant information. Lastly, you upload your products, images, pricing
and product information to start selling online.
It is important to keep you online store updated with correct information
to enhance sales and customer experience.

                              Once you have completed uploading your products and creating your
online store, funds received by Suppl-i for the sale of your goods will be
paid directly to your business bank account. Payments to vendors will
exclude the 3% banking fee and 5% transaction fee as per the Suppl-i
T&C’s.

                            <p>
                         Payments may take up to 3-5 business days to clear in the vendors
account once payments have been cleared and confirmed by Suppl-i.

                                No, a credit or debit card is not required to create a shop. To be
                                verified as a seller you have the choice to use either a credit card
                                or to register via PayPal. You will not incur any charges until you
                                open your shop and publish your listings.
