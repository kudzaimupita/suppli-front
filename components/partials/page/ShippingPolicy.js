                <p>
                    1.1 All orders will be managed by Suppl-i including the
                    Courier Delivery by Suppl-i or its nominee (i.e. a Suppl-i
                    franchisee, an independent contractor or Driver) (the
                    "Courier"):(i) you are required to indicate the physical
                    address to which the order should be delivered to ("Delivery
                    Address");

                <p>
                    1.1.1 the Courier will endeavour to deliver the item to the
                    Customer by the estimated delivery time specified in the
                    Acceptance Notice, however, delivery times are not
                    guaranteed and may be adjusted by us in our reasonable
                    discretion. Events outside of the Courierâ€™s control such as
                    traffic, inclement weather conditions and delays by the
                    Retail store in relation to your order may result in a delay
                    of the delivery of the item, but the Courier will continue
                    with its efforts to deliver the item to the Customer as soon
                    as possible in the circumstances; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.1.2 Our obligation to deliver the item is fulfilled when
                    the Courier delivers the item to the Delivery Address. The
                    Courier is only responsible for the delivery of the item to
                    the Delivery Address. the Courier arrives at the Delivery
                    Address and the Customer fails to open the door or respond
                    to its telephone calls within 10 minutes, the Courier may
                    leave the premises, taking the item with it, and the
                    Customer will remain liable for payment of all order
                    charges. If the Customer is not able to be present at the
                    Delivery Address to accept delivery of the item, or arrange
                    for a different delivery time. Neither Suppl-i nor the
                    Retail store is responsible for any loss or unauthorised
                    consumption of the item, after the Courier has delivered the
                    item to the Delivery Address.

                    set out in the Acceptance Notice. Any dispute regarding the
                    Retail store (The Retailer) failing to make the item
